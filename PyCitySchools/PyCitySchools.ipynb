    "    - the total amount of students in the district.\n",
    "    - the amount of schools in the district.\n",
    "    - the total budget for the district.\n",
    "    - the average math score of students in the district and the percentage of students passing math.\n",
    "    - the average reading score of students in the district and the percentage of students passing reading.\n",
    "    - the overall passing rate of students in the district (students with a score of 70% or higher in both subjects listed above)\n",
    "3. These calculations were used in a snapshot of the district as a whole.\n",
    "4. A similar table to the district snapshot was created with the same data points for each individual school.\n",
    "5. The passing rates of students for both subjects was broken into a grade-by-grade analysis.\n",
    "6. A comparison of student passing rates and budget per capita was created.\n",
    "7. A comparison of student passing rates and school size was created (with schools split into small, medium, or large).\n",
    "8. A comparison of student passing rates and the type of school (district or charter) was created.\n",
    "9. A leaderboard of the highest-performing schools was created.\n",
    "10. A leaderboard of the lowest-performing schools was created."

    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It appears that there is a negative correlation between the amount of the budget spent on students and the success rates of those students.\n",
    "    - In the section [Scores by Student Spending](#scores-spending) on budget used per capita vs. success rate of students: the largest spending group returns with the lowest success rate of students. Looking further into this issue, we can see the nuance that is present: larger schools, which have the lowest success rates of students as noted in [Scores by School Size](#scores-size), are also the schools which are able to spend the most on their students. However: it appears this money is not being used effectively.\n",
    "    - The data presented above suggests that the highest area of concern among large schools is mathematics. Large schools have a 24% lower passing rate in the subject (whereas the reading scores are behind 10% from the other schools); with that in mind, it could be beneficial to the students of larger schools if resources were allocated towards programs and assistance in mathematics. Given that the average score in math is 69.96% for the large schools: a mere 1% increase would improve the overall passing rates for these schools greatly.\n",
    "2. Charter schools see higher success rates for students across the board.\n",
    "   - In the section [Highest-Performing Schools](#highest-scores), the top 8 of 15 schools are charter schools. These charter schools are among the lowest in terms of budget available per student; yet, as in the section [Scores by School Type](#scores-type), the charter schools have a 30% higher overall rate of passing than the district schools. Given this information, I believe it would make sense to create programs for the district schools that are similar to the programs offered in the charter schools because it appears their effectiveness is high.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "If the district schools are able to mimic programs offered in charter schools there could be a great increase in the rate of passing for students of district schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "An area of opportunity exists within the mathematics department: increasing scores there (specifically within the larger schools) would lead to greatly increased passing rates across the board in the district."

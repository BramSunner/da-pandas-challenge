# da-pandas-challenge
Module 4 Challenge for DATA-PT-EAST-APRIL-041524-MTTH.

# About the Project
This project takes in two data sets on a fake school district 'PyCitySchools'.  
One of the files is a csv containing information on the schools in the district.  
The other file is a csv containing information on the students in the district.  

These data sets are cleaned and combined in order to do various aggregations and calculations so that I can make some observations about the school district.  
These observations are in reference to what options the school district has to improve the students' math and reading scores. 

# Built In
Jupyter Notebook (Python).  
Resources for the project are csv files.
